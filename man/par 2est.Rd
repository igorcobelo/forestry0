\description{
Calculates the two-stage and phytosociological sampling parameters.

dest(x,A,an,am,E=0.1,p=0.05,c=1,rn=F,pt=T,prot=NULL,ampl=5,...)
}

\arguments{
  \item{x}{A data frame with seven columns: primary units in the first (in numerals), secondary units in the second (in numerals), numbering of individuals in the third (in numerals), species in the fourth, height in the fifth (in meters), diameter in the sixth (in centimeters) and volume in the seventh (in cubic meters).}
  \item{A}{Total area, in hectares.}
  \item{an}{Area of primary units, in hectares.}
  \item{am}{Area of secondary units, in hectares.}
  \item{E}{Required error, in decimal value. Default is 0.1.}
  \item{p}{Significance level, in decimal value. Default is 0.05.}
  \item{c}{Ratio between average displacement cost and average measurement cost (to be used in calculating the sample intensity of secondary units), in decimal value. Default is 1.}
  \item{rn}{Logical argument. If TRUE (default) calculates the sample intensity once again, with the degrees of freedom from the previous result.}
\item{pt}{Logical argument. If TRUE (default), the language of the outputs is Portuguese. If FALSE, the language is English.}
\item{prot}{Optional. Protected species.}
\item{ampl}{Amplitude of diameter class range. Default is 5.}

\value{
A list of tables and graphs, and a docx file saved in the current directory. The console displays the sampling intensity and whether there is significant difference between the primary units from the F test of the single-factor ANOVA with 95 percent probability.
